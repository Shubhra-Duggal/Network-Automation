## Setup
Mac OS is taken as Ansible engine and the Ubuntu 20.04 is taken as the Ansible client. The [architecture](architecture.md) consists of only 2 machines for experimental purposes. Local (bridged) network has been setup between the two machines. Mac OS is the host machine and Ubuntu 20.04 is the virtual machine on VMWare.
