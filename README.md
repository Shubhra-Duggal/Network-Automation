# Python-for-Network-Automation

Network automation has become a necessary aspect of Software Design Networking. Leveraging this, troubleshooting and configuration of systems can be automated to reduce cost.


## Pexpect

Pexpect is one the python modules that is used to control other applications. It 'spawns' a child application and responds to the expected pattern of queries, like a human user would do. It can be used for SSH, FTP, Telnet, etc. by automating scripts.

The use of the module has been demonstrated in following examples:
1. [Start the interactive python interpreter.](/Explain/python.md)
2. [Start the SSH tunnel.](/Explain/ssh_tunnel.md)
3. [Create a SSH connection to the list of hosts](/Explain/hive.md)
